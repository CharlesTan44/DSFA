My name is Nolan Barham. I'm 17 and super passionate about all technology. I've grown up playing classic games like Mega Man, Portal, and Joust, and I love working with different programs and coding languages! I have lots of experience with design and coding, which makes me a great fit for a computer science internship. I love helping people figure out technology and always give support with a smile on my face!
