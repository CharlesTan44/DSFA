My name is Payton Smith, I grew up on Vashon Island then moved to Seattle where i started my Rectech internship. I am very interested in computer software, and firmware. I am always learning something new, I am good with Sony Vegas Pro 12 and CS5 Adobe After Effects for video editing, and am learning C# and some other languages. I am determined to create a game of my own in unity, and learn as much as i can regarding Software development Custom Firmwares, and networking aswell.
