I’ve grown up with computers since I was 8 years old. As a kid who would constantly break their computer, I learned a lot about problem solving and being self reliant, when it came to fixing my own computer because my parents didn’t know a single thing when it came to tech. Through that old PC, I immersed myself in many flash games and simple browser online games. I want to bring the same immersive and fun experience to those who will grow up with a VR headset on their heads.
